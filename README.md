Task 1 :
📊 Excel Sales Analysis Project

I recently completed an Excel-based data analysis project, where I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights.

🔍 What I did:

Cleaned the dataset by handling null values in the Postal Code column (researched missing codes online)

Engineered new features: Year & Order Days for deeper time-based analysis

Built pivot tables and dashboards to track sales performance by region, category, and time period

Applied conditional formatting and charts to make the insights visually clear and actionable

📈 Key Takeaway:
With the right data cleaning and feature engineering, even Excel can deliver powerful business insights and support decision-making effectively.

Task 2:
🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project

I explored the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival.

🔍 What I did:

Cleaned and preprocessed missing data (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis with bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps

Engineered new features such as Family Size and Age categories

Modeled survival prediction using machine learning classifiers

Discovered key insights:

Women and children had much higher survival chances

1st class passengers were more likely to survive

Higher fares were associated with better survival rates

📈 Key Takeaway:
This project showed how data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA can transform raw historical data into clear insights and predictive models.

Task 3:
🚀 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

I recently worked on a project using the Online Retail dataset (UCI) to better understand customer behavior through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis.

🔍 What I did:

Cleaned and prepared transactional sales data

Engineered RFM features for each customer

Assigned RFM scores and grouped customers into meaningful segments:

🎯 Champions

🤝 Loyal Customers

🌱 Potential Loyalists

⚠️ At Risk

💤 Hibernating

Suggested marketing strategies tailored for each segment (e.g., exclusive offers for Champions, win-back campaigns for At Risk).

Visualized the results with heatmaps and bar charts for clear insights.

📈 Key Takeaway:
RFM Analysis helps transform raw sales data into actionable business strategies—making it easier to retain loyal buyers, re-engage inactive ones, and optimize marketing costs.
